# Predicting-Insurance-Fraud
This repo contains Machine Learning and Data mining R code for a prediction framework to identify fraudulent claims for a major general insurance organization.

Project Objectives: 
-	To build a sophisticated prediction model using machine learning that can classify fraudulent insurance claims using the â€˜F1 statistic' as an error metric for the model accuracy
- To specifically use the decision tree algorithm to analyse and extract the top 20 significant patterns in fraudulent claims.

Folders in the repo:
- Datasets: Containing train and test data
- Code: Containing code files for different parts of the model pipeline: Data preprocessing, EDA, Visualizations, Model Building and Analysis


Results of the project:
